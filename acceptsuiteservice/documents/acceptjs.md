# Accept.js Description

Accept.js is a JavaScript-based solution for sending secure payment data directly to Authorize.Net. The Accept JavaScript library intercepts the payment data before it is passed to merchant server and instead submits it directly to Authorize.Net.

## Prerequisite

SANDBOX: https://jstest.authorize.net/v1/Accept.js

## Accessing Accept.js Page

There are two ways to navigate to Accept.js page.

On click of Cancel button, the page will be redirected to dashboard page.

When click on Pay button in the payment form, sendPaymentDataToAnet function is called.

In this function, based on the selection of payment type between Credit card and Bank Account, Accept.js extracts the payment details from customerâ€™s form as an object named secureData and sends them directly from the customer's web browser.
A response handler function is also written to handle the response of Dispatch Data which returns payment nonce or token.

Accept JS plugin is an existing plugin and Dispatch Data functionality is already present in that plugin. 

The payment data object and response handler function are passed to Authorize.Net using Dispatch Data functionality.

The response handler gets the response from Dispatch Data. This function checks whether the response has any error, if so the errors are displayed on the page.

If there are no errors then the response handler calls the paymentFormUpdate function by passing the response to it.

The paymentFormUpdate function resets all the values in the payment form and gets the opaqueData from the response which contains dataValue field which is the token value.

After receiving the payment nonce / token, we will pass this token and other required details like ApiLoginID, ApiTransactionKey and AcceptJSRequestUrl through Ajax to invoke the Accept JS web API.

Based on the response code of the API call whether Success / Failed we will read the response and will display the confirmation page with Thank You message on the screen and with other details like transaction ID and transaction date on successful transaction.
